* store failure there must not replace the caller's own reason for tearing
* down with a store error. The cost of a false negative is that a cancel
* degrades into a detach — the run record gains `detachedSince`/`sandboxKey`
* instead of transitioning to `'aborted'`. `@tanstack/ai-sandbox`'s
* `reapDetachedRuns` recovers that run once the `detachedRunTtlMs` the
* application passes to that sweep has elapsed — nothing derives it from
* `withSandbox`, which has no TTL option — so the cost is a delayed teardown
* rather than a lost one, provided the application actually schedules the
* sweep, which is its job and not the framework's. Still strictly better than
* failing the teardown.
