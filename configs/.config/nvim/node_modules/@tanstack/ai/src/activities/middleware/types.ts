// ===========================
// Generation middleware
// ===========================
//
// The base, activity-agnostic middleware contract. Every activity — chat and
// the media activities — runs middleware that satisfies this shape. `chat()`
// accepts the richer `ChatMiddleware` superset (it adds config/chunk/tool
// hooks and capability primitives on top of these lifecycle hooks); media
// activities accept `GenerationMiddleware` directly.
//
// The relationship is intentionally STRUCTURAL, not nominal: `ChatMiddleware`
// does not `extends GenerationMiddleware`. Chat hooks use function-property
// syntax, so under `strictFunctionTypes` a narrowed-context subtype would be
// rejected; declaring it via inheritance would force method syntax and reopen
// a bivariance hole (a chat hook reading `ctx.messages` slotted where only a
// base context exists). Instead, the base context/info types are SUPERTYPES
// (fewer fields) and the chat context/info types are SUBTYPES (more fields),
// so a single value whose lifecycle hooks are authored against the base — like
// `otelMiddleware()` — satisfies `GenerationMiddleware & ChatMiddleware` by
// contravariance, while an arbitrary `ChatMiddleware` is NOT assignable to
// `GenerationMiddleware`.

/**
 * The activity an observability event describes.
 *
 * Mirrors the public surface a caller reaches for: `'chat'` for `chat()`,
 * `'summarize'` for `summarize()`, and the media kinds for the `generate*`
 * activities. `'tts'` matches the speech adapter's kind (the public
 * discriminator avoids inventing a parallel `'speech'`/`'text'` vocabulary).
 * `otelMiddleware` maps each to its `gen_ai.operation.name`.
 *
 * `'summarize'` produces text, not media, so it has no artifacts — a
 * persistence middleware stores its run record and result and nothing else.

/**
 * Activity-agnostic, observe-only middleware.
 *
 * A thin lifecycle observer registerable on any activity via its `middleware`
 * option. Unlike `ChatMiddleware` (which can also rewrite config, chunks, and
 * tool calls), these hooks only observe — the right fit for the single
 * request → response shape of media activities. Pass `otelMiddleware()` for
 * OpenTelemetry, or implement the hooks directly for a custom backend.
 *
 * Hooks are awaited in registration order. A hook that throws PROPAGATES and
 * fails the activity — matching `chat()` middleware semantics. Keep them cheap;
 * they run inline with the request.
 *
 * Exactly one of `onFinish` / `onAbort` / `onError` fires per call.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { generateImage } from '@tanstack/ai'
 * import { otelMiddleware } from '@tanstack/ai/middlewares/otel'
 * import { openaiImage } from '@tanstack/ai-openai'
 * import { trace } from '@opentelemetry/api'
 *
 * await generateImage({
 *   adapter: openaiImage('gpt-image-1'),
 *   prompt: 'A serene mountain landscape at sunset',
 *   middleware: [otelMiddleware({ tracer: trace.getTracer('my-app') })],
